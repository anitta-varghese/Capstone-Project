Abstract
The project aims to create a Python-based risk modelling framework for finding capital charge under the Standardized Approach (SA) of the Fundamental Review of the Trading Book (FRTB). The model particularly concentrated on equity derivatives, utilizing simulated data that includes their strike prices, expiry dates, types of options, sensitivity (delta), classified to the specific sector, market capital size, economy categorization. Following the Basel III regulatory framework, the instruments were assigned to respective risk buckets according to predefined rules. The model uses Basel-predefined formulas to calculate intra-bucket and inter-bucket correlations, based on the principles of Modern Portfolio Theory (Markowitz Theorem). The model finds the amount of capital (capital charge) a bank must hold to cover potential losses under extreme market conditions.
Keywords: Fundamental Review of the Trading Book, Standardized Approach (SA), Basel III Regulatory Framework, Capital Charge.
